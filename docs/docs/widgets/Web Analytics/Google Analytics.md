2. Pick a widget you want to add Google Analytics tracking to.
3. Click on the "Web Analytics" tab.
4. Enable the Google Analytics tracking option.
5. Save the widget.

## Usage

Once you've enabled Google Analytics tracking, you will start receiving events in your Google Analytics account. Refer to the events table in the [Overview](./Overview) page to see what events we track.
