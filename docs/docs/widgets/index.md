A widget (a.k.a ‘chatbox’, ‘webchat’, ‘messenger’) is the UI element where your visitors will interact with algomo if you install it on a website.

Quite simply it’s the below box

<!-- ![Widget](./images/Untitled.png -->

<img
src={require('./images/Untitled.png').default}
alt="Widget"
width="400"
/>

In the widget, there are two roles,

1. the **user** (which can be a website visitor or an employee) and
2. the **agent.** The agent can either be a **human** or a **chatbot**
