Visitor Authentication lets you link Algomo visitors to your own users.

### Benefits

- Confirms the visitor's identity, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to impersonate legitimate ones.
- Provides an additional measure to counteract malicious activities.
- Allows conversation history to be consistent and accessible across multiple devices.

## How it works

You can send us data about your users, and we'll use it to link Algomo visitors to your users. Once a visitor is authenticated, you will be able to access their authentication data in Algomo.

### Security

The data you receive from us is signed with a secret key to ensure its authenticity and prevent bad actors from impersonating users. While the data is encoded to prevent tampering, it's important to note that this encoding is not the same as encryption. The data is not hidden, so you should not send any sensitive information.

### Upgrading Anonymous Visitors to Authenticated Users

Anonymous visitors can be seamlessly upgraded to authenticated visitors. This is useful if you want to allow visitors to start a conversation without logging in, but require them to log in before they can access their conversation history.

Once a visitor is authenticated, they will only be able to access their conversations after logging in. This is to prevent unauthorized users from accessing conversations of other users, simply by knowing their ID.

## Setup

> **Note:** Visitor Authentications requires access to server side code of your application. If you're not sure how to do this, please contact us.

To set up Visitor Authentication, you need to:

### 1. Obtain your encryption secret

Navigate to [Settings → General → Visitor Authentication](https://app.algomo.com/settings/general?highlight=visitor-authentication) in Algomo and copy your secret.

### 2. Encrypt your user data on the server

Whenever a user is authorised in your application, encrypt their data using your secret, and include the token in the response to the client.

See [Encrypting user data](./Encrypting%user%20data) for examples on how to do it in popular programming languages.

Make sure a short expiration time for the token — we recommend 30 seconds, and generated a new token for each page load. It is used only during widget initialisation.

### 3. Forward visitor token to the Algomo widget

On client side, include the encrypted visitor token in each page you want to use the widget with visitor authentication.

```html
<script>
  window.algomoSettings = {
    authToken: <GENERATED_AUTH_TOKEN>
  }
</script>
```

You can place the snippet anywhere in your HTML page, but make sure it happens before the widget is initialised.

## Supported fields

We support the following user fields:

- `id`
- `name`
- `email`
- `avatar`
- `companyId`
- `companyName`

**ID field is required. It is used to link the visitor to your user.** Different ID means a different user.

All fields must be strings. If you need to pass a number, convert it to a string first.

### Example user data

```json
{
  "id": "42",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "avatar": "https://example.com/avatar.png",
  "companyId": "2037",
  "companyName": "Acme Inc."
}
```
