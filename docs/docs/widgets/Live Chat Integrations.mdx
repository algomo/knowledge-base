## How it works

You can use the best part of Algomo – its AI capabilities – to automate standard customer service queries and frequently asked questions.

In cases when the AI is not able to help, it can transfer your customers to your support agents, by transitioning users from Algomo widget to your live chat widget.

It will collect customer contact details, generate a summary of the conversation so far and link back to the Algomo conversation in your live chat platform. This will help your customer service agents get up to speed quickly.
