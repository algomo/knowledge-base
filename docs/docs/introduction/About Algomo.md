Algomo is a platform in which you can setup, design, automate and optimize your customer and employee support in 100+ languages, using generative AI.

Our technology can use your existing knowledge base, and APIs to engage in meaningful conversations, schedule appointments, make sales, build your database and many more.

### Architecture

The end-to-end flow of Algomo is the following:

1. The **user** sends a message to Algomo using any **conversation** **channels** you connect to. Conversations can be initiated through Algomo’s Chat Widget, Facebook Messenger, Viber, and many more channels.
2. All conversations from a channel are forwarded to an **inbox**, where they are assigned to a **human agent**, or by a **chatbot.**
3. A chatbot can reply to every message based on information found in **data** **sources**, and live information that can be found in **tools**
4. A **data source** can be the content of a public website, notion pages (like this one!), docx files, **intents,** pdfs, and many other documents
5. **A tool** is a programmatic way for the chatbot to interact with a company’s or external systems, for example, ordering a pizza.
