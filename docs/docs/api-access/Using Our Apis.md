# Generating Responses To Messages

## What is this?

This feature enables you to directly interact with our AI engine, bypassing the traditional widget interface for a more headless approach. By offering this level of access, you can tackle complex use-cases, customizing your AI customer service strategies with greater flexibility and control.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the API, ensure the following:

1. **Create a Chatbot**: Navigate to [Algomo's chatbots dashboard](https://app.algomo.com/bots).
2. **Add Data Sources**: Visit [the data sources dashboard](https://app.algomo.com/data-sources).
3. **Assign Data Sources**: Link the data sources to your chatbot through [the chatbots dashboard](https://app.algomo.com/bots).
4. **Generate an API Token**: Obtain your API token from [the organization settings page](https://app.algomo.com/settings/general).

Perform preliminary tests on your chatbot and adjust your data sources as needed. Use test mode after linking your chatbot to a widget.

## API Endpoint Specifications

### Considerations

- **Rate Limits**: A limit of 5 messages per minute is enforced.
- **Token Rules**: Only one token can be active at a time.
- **Payload Size Limit**: Messages must not exceed 1000 characters.
- **Behaviour/Tools**: This endpoint will only generate responses to messages. Side effects (such as sending emails or escalating conversations) will not be triggered.

### Identifying Your Chatbot ID

Find the chatbot ID in the URL while browsing your bot's page.

## API Call for Bot Response Generation

**HTTP Method**: `POST`  
**Endpoint**: `https://app.algomo.com/api/v2/external/api-access/get-bot-response`

### Request Payload Schema

- **Authorization Header**: Use the Bearer token for authentication in the Authorization header.
- **botId**: The identifier for the chatbot.
- **messageText**: The message that you wish to generate a response for.
