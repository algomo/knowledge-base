Shopify tools enable chatbots to interact with your Shopify stores.

## Types of Tools

### Shopify Product Search

This tool allows chatbots to search for products in your Shopify store.

Your customers can specify what products they are looking for and the chatbot will return the most relevant results. Additionally, a price range can be specified to narrow down the search results.

### Shopify Order Status

This tool allows chatbots to check the status of orders in your Shopify store.

Your customers can specify their email and order number and the chatbot will return the status of the order.

## Setup

1. Navigate to the ["Tools" section in Algomo](https://app.algomo.com/tools).
2. Click "New Tool" in the top right corner and pick a Shopify tool you want to create.
3. In the form enter your store name, store URL (the one ending with ".myshopify.com") and the access key. See ["Creating Shopify access key"](./Creating%20Shopify%20access%20key) for instructions.
