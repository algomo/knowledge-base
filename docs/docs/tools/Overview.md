Tools empower chatbots to use external tools to solve complex customer queries.

## Types of Tools

### Shopify Product Search, Recommendations and Comparison

This tool allows chatbots to search for products in your Shopify store.

Your customers can specify what products they are looking for and the chatbot will return the most relevant results. Additionally, a price range can be specified to narrow down the search results.

### Shopify Order Status

This tool allows chatbots to check the status of orders in your Shopify store.

Your customers can specify their email and order number and the chatbot will return the status of the order.
