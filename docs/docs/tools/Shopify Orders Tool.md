Empower your chatbot with the ability to retrieve order details and provide tracking information to your customers.

## Overview

### Order details

Given a visitor's email and order number your chatbot is able to retrieve their order and provide details such as the order status, fulfilment status, and tracking information.

### Human handover for order-related issues

If the order cannot be found or there is an issue with the order, the chatbot can escalate the conversation to a human agent, ensuring that the customer's issue is resolved.
