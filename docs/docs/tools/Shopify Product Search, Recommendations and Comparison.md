Combines search engine, recommendations engine and comparison engine into a cohesive experience of a smart shopping assistant. It will help your customers to make informed decisions faster by helping them discover what products are available, recommend products based on their needs, enquire about product details and compare them.

## Functionality

### Recommendations

Sometimes you don’t know what exactly you want. Our chatbot can recommend products based on user needs, using data available in your store.

### Search

Once you know what kind of product you’re after, you can search for products from your store. Simply ask the chatbot whether product is available.

You can leverage filters to get exactly what you’re looking for and discover what types of products are available.

### Details and comparison

You can enquire about product details included in descriptions and metadata, including custom metafields.

- Use case: back in stock date. Per-variant back in stock is coming soon.

You can compare 1-3 products in detail and find out what are the main characteristics of larger number of items.

You can create custom filters by creating metafields and enabling them as filters via Search & Discovery app.

### How do I add custom metadata?

## FAQ

### Is it using live data, or do I need to keep it updated myself?

We access live data when requested by your users, which means that it is always up to date.

## Troubleshooting

### I’m asking for a product that exist but the chatbot says it didn’t find anything

We use Shopify Search API under the hood. Check that the search works on the website. If not, consider adding synonyms via Search & Discovery. If it does, let us know.

### Links in product cards are not working

You’re on a development store or your store is password protected.
