### Search

Once you know what kind of product you’re after, you can search for products from your store. Simply ask the chatbot about it. It will help you find the right product and provide you with detailed information about it.

- Use case: back in stock date. Per-variant back in stock is coming soon.

Users can leverage filters in order to discover what types of products are available, narrow down the search and find exactly what they are looking for.

#### Filters and sorting

- Default filters available: price range, availability (if not changed in Search & Discovery)
- Dynamic filters: based on your store’s data, see [Customisation](#customisation) section
- Sorting: by relevance (auto), by price

### Comparison

You can enquire about product details included in descriptions and metadata, including custom metafields. This provides unique value to your customers, as they can arrive at a decision faster. (rephrase that one)

You can compare 1-3 products in detail and find out what are the main characteristics of larger number of items.

## Customisation

### Custom filters

Chatbots using this tool have access to filters set-up in your Shopify store. By default, they include price range and availability.

To provide better search experience, you can add custom filters through the official [Shopify Search & Discovery app](https://apps.shopify.com/search-and-discovery).

#### Adding filters

Once you have the app installed, you can add custom filters by following these steps:

1. Navigate to your [Shopify admin panel](https://admin.shopify.com/), click "Apps" in the left sidebar, and select "Search & Discovery" from the dropdown.
2. Once in the app, navigate to "Filters" in the left sidebar.
3. Click "Add filter", select filter source and set a label. You can select which filter values will be available, as well as combine them into groups. Once you're done, click "Save".

Now, your chatbot will be able to use these filters and will display them in the search results.

#### Custom filters

You might want to expose custom filters to your customers, for example dimensions or color. You can do this by creating metafields and enabling them as filters via Search & Discovery app. See [Custom metadata](#custom-metadata) section for more information.

### Custom metadata

Chatbots using this tool have access to [product metafields](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/custom-data/metafields) and can use them to provide detailed information about products, and to compare products side by side.

Providing custom metadata for the chatbot to use is as simple as adding metafields to your products in Shopify.

For example, you can add a "back in stock date" metafield to your products, and the chatbot will be able to provide this information to your customers.

Refer to this guide on how to add metafields to your products: [Shopify Help Center: Metafields tutorial](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/custom-data/metafields/using-metafields).

## FAQ

### Is it using live data, or do I need to keep it updated myself?

We access live data when requested by your users, which means that it is always up to date.

## Troubleshooting

### I’m asking for a product that exist but the chatbot says it didn’t find anything

We use Shopify Search API under the hood. Often, the issue is with the search settings in your store. Try going to your store website and searching for the product. If it doesn’t show up, it’s likely that the search settings are not set up correctly.

If that's the case, consider adding synonyms via the [Search & Discovery app](https://apps.shopify.com/search-and-discovery).

### Links in product cards are not working

You’re on a development store or your store is password protected.
