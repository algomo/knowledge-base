## Introduction to Data Sources

Data sources play a crucial role in providing information for bots to answer questions. Think of them as the building blocks of knowledge that make up your chatbot. Understanding how data sources work is fundamental to configuring your chatbot effectively.

## Types of Data Sources

There are four primary types of data sources within the system:

- [**Intents**](./Intents.md)
- [**Documents**](./Documents.md)
- [**Websites**](./Website.md)
- [**Notion**](./Notion.md)

## Usage

Creating and uploading data sources is only the first step in the process of building a chatbot. The next step is to connect your data sources to your chatbot so it can use them to answer questions and provide additional context for its responses. This section will walk you through the process of connecting your data sources to your chatbot.

## Connecting Data Sources to Your Chatbot

- To connect your data sources to your chatbot, navigate to [**Algomo**](https://app.algomo.com/) > [**Bots**](https://app.algomo.com/bots) > **select your chatbot**.
- You should see the data sources used by your chatbot (This will be empty if your chatbot has no data sources).
- Click on the **Add Data Source** button
- Select the data source you want to add. This will add the data source to your chatbot.

**Note:** Check the status of your data source on your table, if it is not ready it will not be used by your chatbot.
