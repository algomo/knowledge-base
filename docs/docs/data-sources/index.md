## Introduction to Data Sources

Data sources play a crucial role in providing information for bots to answer questions. Think of them as the building blocks of knowledge that make up your chatbot. Understanding how data sources work is fundamental to configuring your chatbot effectively.

## Types of Data Sources

There are four primary types of data sources within the system:

- [**Intents**](./intents)
- [**Documents**](./documents)
- [**Websites**](./websites)
- [**Notion**](./notion)

## Usage

Creating and uploading data sources is only the first step in the process of building a chatbot. The next step is to connect your data sources to your chatbot so it can use them to answer questions and provide additional context for its responses. This section will walk you through the process of connecting your data sources to your chatbot.

## Connecting Data Sources to Your Chatbot
