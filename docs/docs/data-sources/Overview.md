## Introduction to Data Sources

In this section, we'll explore the concept of data sources within ALGOMO. Data sources play a crucial role in providing information for bots to answer questions. Think of them as the building blocks of knowledge that make up your bot. These sources can take various forms, such as PDF documents, structured Question and Answers (intents), website searches (via Bing or index versions), and more.

Understanding how data sources work is fundamental to configuring your bot effectively. In the following sections, we will delve into the different types of data sources and how they are integrated into the system's workflow.

## Types of Data Sources

There are three primary types of data sources within the system:

- [**Intents**](./Types/Intents.md)
- [**Documents**](./Types/Documents.md)
- [**Website**](./Types/Website.md)
- [**Notion**](./Types/Notion.md)

Each of these data source types follows a distinct lifecycle and serves a unique purpose in the system. Let's explore each of them in greater detail.

## Usage

Creating and uploading data sources is only the first step in the process of building a bot. The next step is to connect your data sources to your bot so it can use them to answer questions and provide additional context for its responses. This section will walk you through the process of connecting your data sources to your bot.

## Connecting Data Sources to Your Bot

- To connect your data sources to your bot, navigate to [**Algomo**](https://app.algomo.com/) > [**Bots**](https://app.algomo.com/bots) > **select your bot**.
- You should see the data sources used by your bot (This will be empty if your bot has no data sources).
- Click on the **Add Data Source** button
- Select the data source you want to add. This will add the data source to your bot.

**Note:** Check the status of your data source on your table, if it is not ready it will not be used by your bot.
