Creating and uploading data sources is only the first step in the process of building a bot. The next step is to connect your data sources to your bot so it can use them to answer questions and provide additional context for its responses. This section will walk you through the process of connecting your data sources to your bot.

## Connecting Data Sources to Your Bot

- To connect your data sources to your bot, navigate to [**Algomo**](https://app.algomo.com/) > [**Bots**](https://app.algomo.com/bots) > **select your bot**.
- You should see the data sources used by your bot (This will be empty if your bot has no data sources).
- Click on the **Add Data Source** button
- Select the data source you want to add. This will add the data source to your bot.

**Note:** Check the status of your data source on your table, if it is not ready it will not be used by your bot.
