### Step 1: Familiarise Yourself with Zapier Terminology

Before diving into creating Zaps, it's essential to understand the key concepts and terminology used in Zapier:

- **Zap:** A Zap is an automated workflow created in Zapier. It consists of a trigger event and one or more actions that occur when the trigger event happens.
- **Trigger:** A trigger is an event that starts a Zap. It could be a new email received, a form submission, or any other event that initiates the workflow.
- **Action:** An action is a task performed by Zapier based on the trigger event. It could be sending data to another application, updating records, or performing any desired action.
- **App:** An app refers to a web application or service that you can connect with Zapier. It could be popular apps like Gmail, Slack, or custom-built applications.
- **Integration:** An integration represents the connection between Zapier and an app. It allows you to access data and perform actions within that app.
