An `Algomo` chatbot contains the necessary information to allow our AI to engage in a natural conversation with a user. Our chatbots are **NATIVELY MULTILINGUAL**, i.e. you can provide information in any language, and they can respond back to any language.

The most important feature of `Algomo` is that you do not need to create a separate chatbot for every new language. It learns from any language, and if there is duplication across languages, then the bot becomes even better.

A chatbot is defined by the following

- [**Data Sources**](/chatbots/Data%20Sources)
- [**Websites**](/chatbots/Websites)
- [**Intents**](/)
