## AI Detection of Urgent Enquiries

You can now configure your chatbots to automatically detect if a customer query requires human intervention, particularly useful if you receive a lot of messages out-of-hours!

When enabled, the chatbot will:

- Set the conversation priority to urgent, and show the escalation reason to customer agents for additional context
- Prompt the customer for their contact details
- Send email alerts to a configurable list of recipients

## Chat Widget Google Analytics

We've also added support for Google Analytics integration in your chat widgets

Visitor interactions with the chat widgets will show as events in your Google Analytics dashboard, including click events of any links that the chatbot suggests in its messages.
