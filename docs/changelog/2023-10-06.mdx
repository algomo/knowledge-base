### **Unified Email Threads and Reply Features in Algomo**

We're thrilled to announce an update that streamlines your email interactions more than ever. Experience a cleaner inbox and better communication with your visitors, all thanks to our new features.

#### Unified Email Threads for Enhanced Communication

- **One Thread to Rule Them All**: Now, all emails pertaining to a particular conversation will land in a unified email thread. This minimises clutter and ensures that you and your team can find all relevant information regarding a conversation in one place.

#### Real-Time Updates from Platform to Email

- **Stay in the Loop**: Messages sent from the Algomo platform will automatically populate in the existing email thread. This ensures continuous, real-time communication without having to switch platforms.

#### Seamless Email Replies

- **Convenience at Your Fingertips**: You can reply directly to the unified email thread, and your responses will be integrated into the existing Algomo conversation, making interactions smooth and effortless.

#### Smart Email Handling

- **Automated Email Attribution**: Our smart system ensures that email replies get attributed to the correct conversation and user.
- **Instant Error Alerts**: If an email reply comes from an address that doesn't match a user an automated email will be sent to notify them of the mismatch.

We believe this update will greatly enhance your communication experience, making it more organized, efficient, and user-friendly. We hope you and your clients find immense value in these improvements!

### **API Access to Algomo Chatbots**

This enhancement offers an alternative to our standard widget interface, providing you with more control and flexibility for handling complex customer service scenarios.

**Direct API Access**: Seamlessly integrate Algomo's AI into your custom applications or services.

**Context Matters**: The API can refer to previous messages in a conversation thread, making responses more contextually relevant.

If you're looking for a way to customize your AI-driven customer engagement, this feature is for you. If you're a developer aiming to integrate Algomo into your app, direct API access provides the flexibility you need.

### Visitor Authentication

In the latest update, we've introduced Visitor Authentication, a feature designed to seamlessly link Algomo visitors with your own user ecosystem. This enhancement serves multiple purposes.

- It allows you to verify visitor identities, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorised impersonations.
- It acts as an extra layer of security to help you mitigate any malicious activities.
- It ensures that a unified conversation history is maintained across multiple devices for each user.
- Once a visitor is authenticated, their data becomes readily accessible within the Algomo interface, streamlining your user management tasks.
