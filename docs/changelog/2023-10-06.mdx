## Emails:

### **Unified Email Threads and Reply Features in Algomo**

We're thrilled to announce an update that streamlines your email interactions more than ever. Experience a cleaner inbox and better communication with your visitors, all thanks to our new features.

### Unified Email Threads for Enhanced Communication

- **One Thread to Rule Them All**: Now, all emails pertaining to a particular conversation will land in a unified email thread. This minimises clutter and ensures that you and your team can find all relevant information regarding a conversation in one place.

### Real-Time Updates from Platform to Email

- **Stay in the Loop**: Messages sent from the Algomo platform will automatically populate in the existing email thread. This ensures continuous, real-time communication without having to switch platforms.

### Seamless Email Replies

- **Convenience at Your Fingertips**: You can reply directly to the unified email thread, and your responses will be integrated into the existing Algomo conversation, making interactions smooth and effortless.

### Smart Email Handling

- **Automated Email Attribution**: Our smart system ensures that email replies get attributed to the correct conversation and user.
- **Instant Error Alerts**: If an email reply comes from an address that doesn't match a user an automated email will be sent to notify them of the mismatch.

We believe this update will greatly enhance your communication experience, making it more organized, efficient, and user-friendly. We hope you and your clients find immense value in these improvements!

## Visitor Authentication:

In the latest update, we've introduced Visitor Authentication, a feature designed to seamlessly link Algomo visitors with your own user ecosystem. This enhancement serves multiple purposes. 

- First, it allows you to verify visitor identities, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorised impersonations.
- Additionally, it acts as an extra layer of security to help you mitigate any malicious activities.
- Notably, the feature also ensures that a unified conversation history is maintained across multiple devices for each user.
- Finally, once a visitor is authenticated, their data becomes readily accessible within the Algomo interface, streamlining your user management tasks.
