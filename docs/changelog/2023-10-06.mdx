### **API Access to Algomo Chatbots**

This enhancement offers an alternative to our standard widget interface, providing you with more control and flexibility for handling complex customer service scenarios.

**Direct API Access**: Seamlessly integrate Algomo's AI into your custom applications or services.

**Context Matters**: The API can refer to previous messages in a conversation thread, making responses more contextually relevant.

### Visitor Authentication

In the latest update, we've introduced Visitor Authentication, a feature designed to seamlessly link Algomo visitors with your own user ecosystem. This enhancement serves multiple purposes.

- It allows you to verify visitor identities, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorised impersonations.
- It acts as an extra layer of security to help you mitigate any malicious activities.
- It ensures that a unified conversation history is maintained across multiple devices for each user.
- Once a visitor is authenticated, their data becomes readily accessible within the Algomo interface, streamlining your user management tasks.
