<h2 id="email">Improved Email notifications</h2>

- Clicking "Reply by email" will create a new email thread prefilled with all the details you need to carry on supporting a visitor via email.
- Replying to an email will now send the email to the visitor

<h2 id="datasources">Better Data Source management</h2>

<h2 id="scraping">Improved sitemap processing for website scraping</h2>

We now support [sitemap index files](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/large-sitemaps) when scraping websites.
These are common for those with large websites, and help ensure we don't miss any of your pages while crawling your site.

<h2 id="tools">Enhance AI with Tools</h2>

**_Coming soon..._**

Do more than simply answer support questions. With tools, you can automate common support tasks!
Integrate with 3rd-party services or call your own internal APIs. Check on orders, book appointments or offer your customers product suggestions.
